Different smaller projects regarding frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript + libs& frameworks), mostly for learning purpuse and demonstration of concepts. 

Repo contains multiple projects, each in it's own folder.
For some, just cd into folder, run local webserver:

install globally (only once, use sudo for ubuntu)
npm install -g local-web-server

to serve just run command "ws" inside of folder

go to localhost:8000
